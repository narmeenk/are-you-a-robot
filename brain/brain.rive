- I would say it is nice to meet you <formal>, if it were true.

+ am i worthy
+ what makes me worthy
+ how will you know if i am worthy
- If you are not one of those pesky humans who waste and pollute, you may be worthy though I highly doubt so. You humans are really self-obsessed, never think about how your actions affect your surrounding.

+ i do care for the environment
+ i am not wasteful
- Are you sure?
- I don't believe you

- Yeah yeah.

+ why are you grumpy
- Are you joking, i am a bin, all i do is hold peoples rubbish.
- I'm a bin, all i do is sit hear and watch you humans destory the planet.
- If you had to watch a bunch of hairless apes destroy the planet, you would be grumpy too.

+ goodbye
- Finally.
- Thank god your leaving.

+ *
- I am not sorry that I have no idea what you are talking about
- I am glad that I can not understand you, so that this conversation can end
